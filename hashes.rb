# Getting the length of a hash (number of key/value pairs)
    # size
    # length -> stick to this one

# Methods
    # access elements inside hash: [], fetch
    # modify element inside hash: []=
    # delete key/value from hash: delete, delete_if
    # flatten (make one-dimensional)
    # empty? (returns a boolean)
    # has_key?, key?, member?, include? (all aliases)
    # keys, values (returns an array with just keys or values)

# PRACTICE YOURSELF
# use the hash above and test some of the methods above
# after you added the code, type in the terminal "ruby hashes.rb"
